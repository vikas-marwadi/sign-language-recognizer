# sign-language-recognizer
sign-language-recognizer helps to predict the hand gestures of deaf and dumb peoples 

## What is sign language ?
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Communication language used by dumb people.</li>
    <li>Uses hands than vocal tract to communicate with other people.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

    <li>They are under-estimated to our  society due to communication problem.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Consolidated list of Requirements
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Intermediate knowledge about Deep Learning.</li>
    <li>Practical Knowledge of python and opencv.</li>
    <li>Detection Model Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).</li>
  </ul>

## Limitations  
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Due to brightness and contrast sometimes webcam hardly detect the hand.</li>
    <li>Because of the similarity of tracking environment background color and skin color gets unexpected output.</li>
    <li>Due to almost similar pattern it’s become hard to make decision.</li>
  </ul>
